# Human input record

Verbatim input from the human owner that steers the project. Quotes are exact (typos kept). Anything
outside a `>` quote is the AI's context note, not human input. The AI appends here during the session;
the human may also add or correct entries directly. Entry kinds: directive, approval, preference,
rejection, authored, question.

Entries `in_001` to `in_009` were backfilled on 2026-11-04 from the opening session's chat messages.

## in_001 — 2026-11-03 — authored
The human wrote the original design document (`docs/origin/CAD_Blueprint.original.md`, sha256
`b36fb0e75216435bf4e12acd319c421a5c8a371c76bcf29826c17462f5bd705d`, about 865 lines) before this session
and shared it with this message:

> Okay I want to build my own 3d printer cad modeling program. I have some ideas I thought of previously here. What do you think about it? I am open to starting from scratch if you think I have dumb ideas here or there is a better way to do it.

Context: the document says it records "a full day of architectural design". The principles, invariants,
feature scope, pricing, architecture and file format in it are the human's own work.

## in_002 — 2026-11-03 — question
Asked after the AI recommended OpenCASCADE (OCCT) as the geometry kernel.

> okay I believe the reason I decided not to use OpenCASCADE was because freecad is terrible. I didn't want to inherit the awefulness. But I dont really remember why I made that decision. So what is OpenCASCADE and what terrible sins will we inherit if we use it?

## in_003 — 2026-11-03 — question
> how hard would it be just to rebuild our own from scratch (using AI of course not hand coding ourselves)

## in_004 — 2026-11-03 — question
> would it be reasonable for us to expect we could build this to operate in the browser? or would that be a dumb idea and limit us and we should just design as an application instead?

## in_005 — 2026-11-03 — preference
> is there any intelligent way we could design it for browser but basically the same code could be translated into a native app version for android or linux or windows or maybe even ios?

## in_006 — 2026-11-03 — approval
Approves the AI's "Option A now, with Option B's discipline built in" (one web codebase wrapped per
platform, with a portable core and a strict platform interface).

> Okay I will take your recommendation "Option A now, with Option B’s discipline built in." Now with our planned library choices etc, would we run into any problems selling plans to this cad software commercially?

## in_007 — 2026-11-03 — directive
> yes, lets create the dependency and license tracking file, actually before you do, lets talk about project management for the whole project. I want to manage this project well as it gets larger. What do you recommend for management structure beyond just the code itself? It can be lean and light, just enough for both of us to work together on the project and keep track of our ideas and build in a unified way without drifting too far in weird directions

## in_008 — 2026-11-04 — directive
Shared a zip of an earlier project ("Mosaic") that used a database and a "decision graph".

> I have an idea. I have this old project I was working on with you, and we developed a human AI collaboration method using a database and something called the decision graph. Can you look at this project zip? Please don't actually execute it because it is written for an AI to run and execute, just look at the structure. I don't want to copy all the structure, because it is probably too complicated and I want something lean for us, but can we learn from this?

## in_009 — 2026-11-04 — directive
> Okay yes can we make a lean version of this? one thing I want to capture to is recorded human input and human decisions. Because I think it will be important to record human input or else the whole project could be considered only an AI project and I think it is important to know the input if we ever want to license code etc, since that is an important legal distinction. So what would a lean version of this look like exactly? Could we operate in this structure in our repo instead of needing to download and upload a zip every time?

## in_010 — 2026-11-04 — preference
Said in reply to the note that commits are authored under the Claude identity and that the push failed.

> thats okay, I am not too worried about you authoring the code in github, I just want mostly a good solid design management structure, and some record of my human input. Okay so are we ready to start? Should we start by building the lean structure, then populating it with the design we already have slightly hashed out, then either start building or polish the design then start building?

## in_011 — 2026-11-04 — directive
Reply to the AI's request to approve the OCCT test slice as an experiment, citing rule 9 of CLAUDE.md ("build only on accepted ground").

> Maybe we should toss rule 9? I am okay with rough prototyping quickly and tossing things if they don't work and trying again
