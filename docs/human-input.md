# Human input record

Verbatim input from the human owner that steers the project. Quotes are exact (typos kept). Anything
outside a `>` quote is the AI's context note, not human input. The AI appends here during the session;
the human may also add or correct entries directly. Entry kinds: directive, approval, preference,
rejection, authored, question.

Entries `in_001` to `in_009` were backfilled on 2026-11-04 from the opening session's chat messages.

## in_001 — 2026-11-03 — authored
The human wrote the original design document (`docs/origin/CAD_Blueprint.original.md`, sha256
`b36fb0e75216435bf4e12acd319c421a5c8a371c76bcf29826c17462f5bd705d`, about 865 lines) before this session
and shared it with this message:

> Okay I want to build my own 3d printer cad modeling program. I have some ideas I thought of previously here. What do you think about it? I am open to starting from scratch if you think I have dumb ideas here or there is a better way to do it.

Context: the document says it records "a full day of architectural design". The principles, invariants,
feature scope, pricing, architecture and file format in it are the human's own work.

## in_002 — 2026-11-03 — question
Asked after the AI recommended OpenCASCADE (OCCT) as the geometry kernel.

> okay I believe the reason I decided not to use OpenCASCADE was because freecad is terrible. I didn't want to inherit the awefulness. But I dont really remember why I made that decision. So what is OpenCASCADE and what terrible sins will we inherit if we use it?

## in_003 — 2026-11-03 — question
> how hard would it be just to rebuild our own from scratch (using AI of course not hand coding ourselves)

## in_004 — 2026-11-03 — question
> would it be reasonable for us to expect we could build this to operate in the browser? or would that be a dumb idea and limit us and we should just design as an application instead?

## in_005 — 2026-11-03 — preference
> is there any intelligent way we could design it for browser but basically the same code could be translated into a native app version for android or linux or windows or maybe even ios?

## in_006 — 2026-11-03 — approval
Approves the AI's "Option A now, with Option B's discipline built in" (one web codebase wrapped per
platform, with a portable core and a strict platform interface).

> Okay I will take your recommendation "Option A now, with Option B’s discipline built in." Now with our planned library choices etc, would we run into any problems selling plans to this cad software commercially?

## in_007 — 2026-11-03 — directive
> yes, lets create the dependency and license tracking file, actually before you do, lets talk about project management for the whole project. I want to manage this project well as it gets larger. What do you recommend for management structure beyond just the code itself? It can be lean and light, just enough for both of us to work together on the project and keep track of our ideas and build in a unified way without drifting too far in weird directions

## in_008 — 2026-11-04 — directive
Shared a zip of an earlier project ("Mosaic") that used a database and a "decision graph".

> I have an idea. I have this old project I was working on with you, and we developed a human AI collaboration method using a database and something called the decision graph. Can you look at this project zip? Please don't actually execute it because it is written for an AI to run and execute, just look at the structure. I don't want to copy all the structure, because it is probably too complicated and I want something lean for us, but can we learn from this?

## in_009 — 2026-11-04 — directive
> Okay yes can we make a lean version of this? one thing I want to capture to is recorded human input and human decisions. Because I think it will be important to record human input or else the whole project could be considered only an AI project and I think it is important to know the input if we ever want to license code etc, since that is an important legal distinction. So what would a lean version of this look like exactly? Could we operate in this structure in our repo instead of needing to download and upload a zip every time?

## in_010 — 2026-11-04 — preference
Said in reply to the note that commits are authored under the Claude identity and that the push failed.

> thats okay, I am not too worried about you authoring the code in github, I just want mostly a good solid design management structure, and some record of my human input. Okay so are we ready to start? Should we start by building the lean structure, then populating it with the design we already have slightly hashed out, then either start building or polish the design then start building?

## in_011 — 2026-11-04 — directive
Reply to the AI's request to approve the OCCT test slice as an experiment, citing rule 9 of CLAUDE.md ("build only on accepted ground").

> Maybe we should toss rule 9? I am okay with rough prototyping quickly and tossing things if they don't work and trying again

## in_012 — 2026-11-04 — approval
Approves the AI's proposal to write `docs/licenses.md` and then build the first prototype (`prototypes/kernel-slice/`: OCCT in WASM, JSON operation graph, sketch/extrude/hole/fillet in a browser view, a reference-stability test and a corpus of awkward boolean and fillet cases).

> yes, go ahead with licenses.md then the prototype

## in_013 — 2026-11-04 — directive
After trying the first prototype locally ("okay I launched it, nice start!") and being offered five next steps, chose the interactive sketch-to-extrude prototype.

> Let's do the interactive sketch to extrude one

## in_014 — 2026-11-04 — preference
First hands-on feedback on `prototypes/sketch-extrude` (a usability problem report).

> I am having trouble with it. I click R and click and nothing happens?

## in_015 — 2026-11-04 — directive
After hands-on use of `prototypes/sketch-extrude`; resets the interface work and sets the order: planes and navigation first, then sketching on a plane, then extruding on the plane.

> Okay why don't we nail down the interface to start. Lets clear away a bunch of stuff so we dont have clutter and start from scratch. Let me describe what I want and you can toss what is not applicable. We dont have to start from actual scratch because some of what you built is good. So Here is what I think we should do, there should be a 3d view like in your other model. That 3d view should have xyz planes that go on forever. You should be able to select a plane to sketch on. When you select a plane, it should go normal to that plane. You should be able to still roll around in 3d view, but clicking on the plane brings you back normal to it. Lets do that first. Then we can move on to sketching on the plane. Then extruding on the plane.

## in_016 — 2026-11-04 — directive
Feedback on `prototypes/cad-ui` stage 1, plus a problem report about `tools/preview.sh`.

> Okay pretty good. Now it is a little hard to see properly visually. Can we make the grid not be a grid at all? maybe only when we are in sketch mode. But in 3d mode can we try just semi transparent sheets on whatever sheet is hovered to select? Also for some reason I have to run the bash command twice to get the recent edits "bash ~/Documents/cad/tools/preview.sh"

## in_017 — 2026-11-04 — directive
Reply to the finite-sheet version of `prototypes/cad-ui` (the AI had asked whether finite sheets were what was meant).

> Lets drop the xyz buttons and reduce clutter. I meant infinite sheets. Lets add the grid back to the sheets because that helps use know that we are zooming or not. But lets make it a very light gray grid. Lets add a fog to the view so that things further out in the distance fade. Lets have it so things are either un-selected gray or blue when selected. The xyz world lines can keep their colors.

## in_018 — 2026-11-04 — directive
> Can we have the fog a little stronger. Can we have it only show the selected sheet. Can we try a light world instead of dark.

## in_019 — 2026-11-04 — directive
> Okay lets make the white world slightly more gray or paper colored ( very slight cream gray white) Lets make the blue slightly more dusty blue teal. Lets make the sub grid slightly darker and more defined. Lets make the xyz arrow indicators built directly into the main xzy world lines to reduce clutter. lets have the fog get slightly darker the further out it goes.

## in_020 — 2026-11-04 — directive
> Okay lets just try light charcoal grey for the grid lines. Lets make the fog a darker charcoal grey. lets have it so that when you go back into 3d mode you can select any plane again.

## in_021 — 2026-11-04 — directive
> Lets keep getting it because the user interface foundations are really important because that is the context that every other thing will be tested in. So lets make it un-select the selected grid when you go back into 3d mode. Lets make the grid darker charcoal. Also does the grid have a blue hint at all anymore? lets drop it. Lets just use paper gray (slight cream tiny amount) and charcoal greys. Also the fog needs to be much darker charcoal grey.

## in_022 — 2026-11-04 — directive
> Okay but it looks like the plane itself gets darker, not that it is protruding deeper into dark fog. Can you make the fog be world fog, not on the planes. Almost like the whole world is dark but a light is shining on the plane.

## in_023 — 2026-11-04 — preference
Reply to the dark-world / lit-plane version, with a screenshot of a low-angle view (camera just above the XY plane): the plane fades toward a dark horizon.

> Looks better, but it doesn't really look like the camera goes through the plane at low angles. It kinda looks like the plane separates and goes away or fades away

## in_024 — 2026-11-04 — directive
> Okay that is pretty good! Now can you please give me a temporary version with knobs to adjust the colors brightness, shades etc, so that I can hand you back exact values to apply?

## in_025 — 2026-11-04 — directive
The human tuned the look with the temporary tuning panel (`bash tools/preview.sh tune`) and pasted the panel's text back. The human-readable "Exact values" block is quoted below; the same message also contained the panel's JSON block with identical numbers, which was applied to `settings.js`.

## in_026 — 2026-11-04 — directive
> yes, start stage 2 with the sketching tools. But before we do, should we think about user adopting us? what are they used to? should we borrow hot key patterns or other interface patterns from solid works? or blender? or another popular cad program?

## in_027 — 2026-11-04 — preference
Reply to the AI's list of what users carry between CAD programs (mouse navigation, a few single-letter hotkeys plus undo/redo, the workflow model, typing a number to set a size) and its question about which programs the human has used.

> okay lets get "Mouse navigation. This is the biggest one.
> A handful of single-letter hotkeys, plus undo and redo.
> The workflow model: sketch, finish, extrude, with a history list.
> Typing a number to set a size." right, and the only program I really used much and liked was shapr 3d, but even then I thought it could be improved and I am not sure I want to copy it
